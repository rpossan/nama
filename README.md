# Nama - Backend Evaluation Problem

This is a project to evaluate the backend Nama problem.
I implemented a ruby gem library that test the extract of labels from interval as the requirement.
I tried to use the best practices for a backend project and all methods are tested. I choose minitest as the test framework because has the simplest setup.
The project was developed under git flow and pull request made the atomic commits on master branch
